<title>T17 Computer</title>
<section>
  
<p>The <b>T17 computer</b> in the common room works as a diary, chat,
planner, and generally useful/amusing thing.

<p>It is an on-going experiment with running a shared home computer
based on cheap hardware and free software.

<p>The base software is Linux, <a href=https://www.gnu.org>GNU</a>,
and GNU&nbsp;Emacs.

<p>Since the whole system is <a href=https://www.fsf.org>free
software</a>, we are able to study and modify the code as much as we
want without any license fees or restrictions.
