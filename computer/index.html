<title>T17 Computer</title>
<section>
  
<p>The <b>T17 computer</b> in the common room works as a diary, chat,
  planner, and generally useful/amuseful thing.

<p>It is an on-going experiment with running a shared home computer
based on cheap hardware and free software.

<p>The actual budget was around 25 EUR for
the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi B+</a>
computer plus a used 17" Dell monitor for 10 EUR and a used keyboard
for 3 EUR.

<p>The software on it is free software, which means that we
are free to study, modify, and extend the code.

<p>The software is the GNU system with a Linux kernel and Emacs
user interface.

<p>Despite running in console mode, the T17 computer is somewhat
user friendly.
